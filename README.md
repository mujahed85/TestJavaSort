    <div class="panel-heading">1) Would you define DevOps as a framework or a programming language?</div>

    <div class="panel-body">To be precise, DevOps is neither a framework nor a programming language. In fact, it is an innovative blend of both. DevOps combines development and operations to build a software which enhances the productivity of the organizations and enables them to deliver high-quality service promptly.</div>

    <div class="panel-body">Simply put, DevOps bring together the best of both worlds in order to enhance the efficiency and performance of the software with a minimum scope of error. Development features like faster deployment, feedback, and testing tools are incorporated alongside operational attributes such as virtualization, continuous monitoring, configuration management et al.  
    This provides a foolproof structure to the cloud platform, and in many ways, DevOps is the driving force of a cloud platform which makes businesses adaptable to the current needs.</div>

    <div class="panel-heading">4) What are the benefits of using AWS for DevOps?</div>

    <div class="panel-body">AWS for DevOps ushers a whole gamut of advantages. Some of them are:  

    *   **Easy to start and easy to use:** Unlike the traditional software development processes where the first step would be to install a particular software, AWS does not have any additional installation requisites. All you need is to open an AWS account online to access the treasure trove of Amazon Web Services.
    *   **Comprehensive services:** AWS offers fully managed operations, so the customers need not spend any additional time and resource on infrastructural requirements such as setting up and installation. As soon as you set up your AWS account, the infrastructural requirements are automatically taken care of by DevOps. This enables the customers to direct their attention straight to building their core product.
    *   **Enhanced Scaling:** In today’s world of e-commerce, scaling is winning. Speedy delivery of applications is the key to securing your client base. In that regard, AWS’s simplified provisioning, configuration, and scaling features make it feasible to scale up from a single instance to multiples of thousands without any additional software interventions.
    *   **Flexible programming:** AWS is highly programmable and may be adapted to suit the needs of the vendors individually. While customers may avail of all the services provided by AWS through the AWS Command Line Interface, there is also an option for customizing your service requirements with the help of the declarative AWS Cloud Formation templates, which allows you to provision the AWS resources and infrastructure according to your specific needs.
    *   **Automation:** An vital aspect of the enhanced speed of deployment and delivery in AWS is ascertained by the increased automation in AWS. AWS lets you focus on building the core product efficiency by eliminating the need for manual interventions in tasks such as deployment, development, and testing of workflows, configuration management, and container management.
    *   **Reliable and Secure:** AWS includes a watertight security system to ensure your data is immune to any security breaches. The AWS Identity and Access Management mechanism grants the customer complete control over the access and use of their resources. Customers can set permissions about access to different levels of information as per their own policies.
    *   **A large community of customers and partners:** AWS have significantly transformed the e-commerce ecosystem by directly integrating a considerable cohort of customers and service partners. Members of this dynamic community can forge a granular connection with the other party using AWS tools and deliver or access end to end solutions. The availability of an enormous variety of services is also a unique feature of AWS.
    *   **Pay-As-You-Go:** This feature is what really sets AWS apart. Unlike traditional platforms, AWS does not levy any upfront fees or paid package to avail of their services. You may opt for specific services and pay only for those and for the period of time that suits your needs. AWS does not impose any contractual obligations.

    <div class="panel-heading">5) How does AWS DevOps facilitate Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery?</div>

    <div class="panel-body">AWS DevOps tools let the programmer be in control at all points. The automation feature dilutes the need for manual interventions, even in complex ecosystems. It makes it possible for the developer to securely store their code in the AWS system while automatically building, testing, and deploying the application in the developers’ target premises. These tools make sure that the product efficiency isn’t compromised due to manual tasks, and instead, continuous integration and consistent delivery can be achieved.  
    AWS DevOps tools such as AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodeDeploy are some of the tools popularly used for this purpose.</div>

    <div class="panel-heading">6) What are some of the popular AWS DevOps tools?</div>

    <div class="panel-body">

    1.  **AWS CodePipeline**  
        AWS CodePipeline automatically builds, tests, and deploys the application to the target on-premise whenever the programmer makes any change in the code. This feature is mostly responsible for continuous integration and continuous delivery. This makes it possible to maintain consistently fast delivery and manage all infrastructural updates of the application without any operational hassles.

    3.  **AWS CodeBuild**  
        AWS CodeBuild is a granular code building tool that is fully managed in order to build source codes, run tests, and make ready to deploy software packages. By virtue of the AWS CodeBuild, developers need to wait for their codes to be scaled since it continuously and simultaneously scales multiple builds.

    5.  **AWS CodeDeploy**  
        This is an automated code deployment mechanism that makes AWS deploy your applications to an on-premise at any instance. This is strategic in releasing new features in a time and cost-efficient manner, avoiding any downtime or software challenges during such updates.

    7.  **AWS CodeStar**  
        AWS CodeStar provides a unified user interface that enables you to develop and deploy applications fast on AWS. With this feature, you can build the entire delivery toolchain at once since CodeStar lets you manage all aspects of software management in one place.

    9.  **AWS CodeCommit**  
        This feature enables organizations to host and securely store private Git repositories. This makes AWS DevOps work seamlessly with GIT tools without the intervention of the developer to manage their source control systems.
